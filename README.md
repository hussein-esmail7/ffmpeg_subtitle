## What is this?
This program adds a subtitle file to a movie. Note that this can only be done once to a movie (the second time would override the first). 

## Installation
Copy and paste this command to download this repository after you've changed directories to the folder you want.
```
git clone https://github.com/hussein-esmail7/ffmpeg_subtitle
```
Then change directories into that folder.
```
cd ffmpeg_subtitle
```
After that is done, you can now run the subtitle program.
```
python3 sub.py
```
