# ffmpeg_subtitle
This program adds a subtitle file to a movie. Note that this can only be done once to a movie (the second time would override the first). 

# Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/hussein-esmail7/ffmpeg_subtitle
```
Then change directories into that folder.

After that is done, you can now run the subtitle program.
